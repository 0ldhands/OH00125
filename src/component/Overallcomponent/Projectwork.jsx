      "During the early period of my career, although computers were used for posting vouchers, the paybill calculation was still done manually. One staff member would spend an entire day completing the calculation and preparing vouchers.",
      "When this work was assigned to me, I created a ledger in Excel that automatically generated vouchers by populating data from the main sheet. The vouchers could then be printed and used directly, reducing one full day‚Äôs work to just one hour.",
      "This solution remained in use for 2‚Äì3 years until the process was fully automated through the banking system.",

    description: [
      "While serving as Assistant Manager at the Kancheepuram branch, we relied on manual cash chittas for recording receipts and payments. Identifying mismatches was time-consuming, as handwritten ledgers made error tracking difficult.",
      "I developed an Excel tool to capture receipts and payments along with denominations, making it easy to identify shortages or excess amounts, and even pinpoint the specific denomination. In addition, I built tools for denomination checking, coin war, and cash ledger automation.",
      "A key challenge was converting numbers to words, since Excel lacked this feature. I solved this by writing a VBA script for number-to-words conversion.",
      "This Cash Book solution was successfully used for almost 8 years. Even after the banking software was upgraded to handle denomination entries, the tool continued to support other operational tasks.",

      "At the Kancheepuram branch, which was a heavy jewel loan branch, we processed 60‚Äì70 jewel loans daily (sometimes up to 100 on peak days). Each loan required manual preparation of multiple vouchers‚Äîloan creation, fund transfer, appraiser commission, bank commission‚Äîas well as manual creation of jewel packet labels.",
      "To streamline this, I developed an Excel solution where, once basic data was entered, all required vouchers were automatically generated with a single click. Label creation was handled using a mail merge technique, enabling bulk printing of labels for jewel packets.",
      "This automation reduced the workload by nearly 90%, allowing staff to focus on other important tasks.",

            All of the above Excel projects were entirely self-initiated and
            served as highly effective tools in daily operations. They not only
            improved efficiency but also earned appreciation from higher
            management. Beyond these, I implemented several smaller process
            improvements that added value to routine work.
